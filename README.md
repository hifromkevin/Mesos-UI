# Mesos-UI
A visual representation of a new Mesos interface.

## Requirements
- Node 6.13.0

## Installing Dependencies

From within the root directory:
```sh
npm install 
npm start

Go to http://localhost:9000/ on your browser
```

## Selected Libraries and Technologies
- React: React state was the perfect setup to store the servers and available apps. Also, React has built-in commands such as hover, which will come in handy in future iterations of this application. 
- SASS: Preferred over CSS due to the ability to add variables. As such, changing a color, for example, will only need to be performed in one spot, rather than making the change in multiple locations.
- Webpack Dev Server: Given the time constraints, Webpack Dev Server made it simple to get a working MVP up and running.
